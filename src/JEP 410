2.10. Remove the Experimental AOT and JIT Compiler (JEP 410)
Introduced into JDK 9 and JDK 10, respectively, as experimental features, the Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation (JEP 295) and Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler from GraalVM (JEP-317) were features with a high cost of maintenance.

On the other hand, they had no significant adoption. Because of that, this JEP removed them from the platform, but developers can still leverage them using GraalVM.
