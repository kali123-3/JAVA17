/*
The Vector API deals with the SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) type of operation,
meaning various sets of instructions executed in parallel. It leverages specialized CPU
hardware that supports vector instructions and allows the execution of such instructions as pipelines.

As a result, the new API will enable developers to implement more efficient code,
leveraging the potential of the underlying hardware.

Everyday use cases for this operation are scientific algebra linear applications,
 image processing, character processing, and any heavy arithmetic application or any
 application that needs to apply an operation for multiple independent operands.

Letâ€™s use the API to illustrate a simple vector multiplication example:
 */
public class VectorAPI {

    public void newVectorComputation(float[] a, float[] b, float[] c) {
        for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i += SPECIES.length()) {
            var m = SPECIES.indexInRange(i, a.length);
            var va = FloatVector.fromArray(SPECIES, a, i, m); //FLOAT VECTORE
            var vb = FloatVector.fromArray(SPECIES, b, i, m);
            var vc = va.mul(vb); //Multiplicaiton
            vc.intoArray(c, i, m);
        }
    }

    public void commonVectorComputation(float[] a, float[] b, float[] c) {
        for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i ++) {
            c[i] = a[i] * b[i];
        }
    }
}
